		<P>I have 3 poodles which I enjoy playing with all the time. Being off at college I don't get to see them nearly as much. All 3 of them are getting old but they ar stil very active and playful. Two of my poodles are black and the other one is white, one of them that is black has a tan color on its paws which is very unique. My favorite poodle is the black one with no spots because she is very playful and she allows you to hold her easily.</P>
