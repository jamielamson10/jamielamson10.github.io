		<P>I like to hang out with my friends when ever I can. Before I left for college I had to leave early a month before all my friends did because of football. So because of that I couldnt hang out with them which sucked. Prior to me leaving We would always play poker at someones house or we would play spikeball. I also like to play sports which has been a big part of my life.</P>
